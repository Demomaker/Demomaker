Hello, I'm demomaker!
I like to work on small to medium size projects (mostly on my own) in my spare time.
I also produce music and create gaming videos as well as computer science videos.
For more info, check out my website down below (I haven't added SSL yet, but don't worry, nothing personal is being kept in my website):
